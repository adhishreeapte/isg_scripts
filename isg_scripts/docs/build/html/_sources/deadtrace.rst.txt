Deadtrace
=========

Deadtraces are taken with sparkplug removed. 
Example ``config.json`` file is shown below:

.. code-block:: bash

    {
    "sym_file" : "Symbol_file_isg_assist_codebase.sym",
    "trace_file" : "true_dead_cranks_v13.trc",
    "m_speed" : "Bemf_Speed_RPM",
    "operation_mode" : "MEAS_OPMODE",
    "battery_current" : "IDC_Estimated",
    "battery_voltage" : "Vbat",
    "u_theta" : "MEAS_UTHETA",
    "ia" : "IA"
    }


Example set of config, ``trace_file``, and ``sym_file`` files are `config.json <_static/files/deadtrace/deadconfig.json>`_, `trace.trc <_static/files/deadtrace/deadtrace.trc>`_ and `symbol.sym <_static/files/Symbol_file_isg_assist_codebase.sym>`_. 


Command below is used to analyse deadtrace taken from PCAN. 


.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: Command

    isg.deadtrace --config deadconfig.json



Description of config.json file:

* "sym_file" : Name of PCAN ``.sym`` file
* "trace_file" : Name of ``trace`` file
* "m_speed" : Speed variable name in ``.sym`` file
* "operation_mode" : Op_mode variable name in ``.sym`` file
* "battery_current" : Ibat variable name in ``.sym`` file
* "battery_voltage" : Vbat variable name in ``.sym`` file
* "u_theta" : U_theta variable name in ``.sym`` file
* "ia" : Phase current variable name in ``.sym`` file


Description of script:

* Script calculates reverse bang time based on utheta. 
* Sci-py is used to find compression times to isolate thermodynamic cycles. 
* Statistics of power drawn from the battery, battery-current, battery-voltage and energy consumed per cycle are generated. 
* At every compression, current drawn from battery is maximum and battery voltage dips to a minimum. 
* Thus, statistics include maximum, mean of ibat and minimum, mean of vbat.


Figure output is placed in folder named ``isg_plots`` created at the location of terminal initiation. 
A sample subset of the output-figures is shown below.

Text-output include line rms maximum and average written in ``deadtrace_output.csv`` file at terminal location.
